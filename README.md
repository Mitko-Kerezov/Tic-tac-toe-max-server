# Tic-tac-toe-max-server
Server for the Tic Tac Toe Max game. Part of the project for FMI's Advanced JS course.

Realization was achieved using TypeScript as a programming language, developed under [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

The actual playing (making a move) was realized using the [ws npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) and authentication was realized with json web tokens.

The Mobile Client consuming the server can be found [here](https://github.com/Mitko-Kerezov/Tic-Tac-Toe-Max-MobileClient).
